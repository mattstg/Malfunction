    "Tutorial_1":"Asteroids are incoming and Earth is in danger! We need to design a rocket defense system, however we need to calculate the trajectory of the rockets to intercept the asteroids",
    "Tutorial_2":"This is a Cartesian Grid",
    "Tutorial_3":"The Cartesian Grid breaks up space into numerical coordinates. Points on this grid can be represented by two values, X and Y. Written as (x,y)",
    "Tutorial_4":"The location of the rocket is currently at (3,9) on the Cartesian Grid, because it is at the intercept of 3 on the X-axis (seen on bottom) and 9 of the Y-axis (seen on left)",
    "Tutorial_5":"The Rocket Launcher is at (0,0)",
    "Tutorial_6":"Enter the co-ordinates of the incoming asteroid in the fields provided and press Submit",
    "Tutorial_7":"Correct, the incoming asteroid is at (5,10)",

    "Tutorial_8":"It seems our rocket is off course, the trajectory (direction) a rocket will travel can be represented by a <b>Function</b>",
    "Tutorial_9":"A function applies a <b>rule</b> to an <b>input</b> and produces an <b> output </b>",
    "Tutorial_10":"For example the <b>function</b> that represents the rocket is <b>y = 3x</b> \n By putting in the <b>input</b> 3 as the x, we get an <b>output</b> y of 9. \n This is by substituting the x in the equation with 3. so y = 3*3, which is 9.",

	"Tutorial_13":"As we can see, the formula is wrong, the rocket never intercepts the asteroid. The asteroid as previously discovered on the Cartesian grid is at the X of 5. If we plug that into the rocket trajectory function y = 3x, we get 15 = 3*(5)",
  	"Tutorial_14":"The actual function rule is y = 2x. Using this function rule and the input of X as 5, solve for the output below.",
	"Tutorial_14_Wrong":"Incorrect, try substituting X with 5, so y = 2x becomes y = 2*(5). Enter the value of Y below",
	"Tutorial_15":"Correct! The function y = 2x with the input of x as 5 becomes y = 2*5, which is 10.",
	"Tutorial_16":"Great, these functions will allow us to understand how to aim and build defenses. Solving functions by entering the output with a given input will earn Science Points (seen in the top right)",
	"Tutorial_17":"By solving functions, our new defenses can automatically use them to aim at incoming asteroids.",
	"Tutorial_18":"Science points can can be used to purchase Rocket Launchers, Nuke Launchers, and Shields (Shields are more useful once you have a few rockets) The icons have the price next to them.",
	"Tutorial_19":"Functions will get harder over time, some will even have multiple inputs. \n These are represent as such \n<b>Rule: </b>3x + 5y + 2\n<b>Input: </b>(x,y) = (2,3)\n So the output would be 3*2 + 5*3 + 2 = 23",
	"Tutorial_20":"Harder functions are worth more science, getting a question wrong deducts science.",
	"Tutorial_21":"Are you ready? Solve functions as fast as you can to purchase as many defenses as quickly as you can! Don't worry the rockets will auto-aim, protecting you scientists and engineers long enough to solve more functions. But we need you to solve quickly to buy more! They wont last long.",
